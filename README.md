# CS 20: Midterm Practice Questions – Data Structures

This repository contains practice problems completed in preparation for the **CS 20 Data Structures** midterm exam. The exercises cover a wide range of foundational topics, from basic recursion to core data structures like **linked lists**, **trees**, **stacks**, **queues**, and **sorting algorithms**.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of these solutions. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I was also still learning GitHub at the time, so some files may reflect early version control practices.

## ✨ Overview

The problems here were based on likely midterm content and designed to reinforce understanding of:

- How data structures work under the hood
- Algorithm implementation in C++
- Hands-on application of recursion, iteration, and memory management

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Each file addresses a specific concept or problem type.
- Solutions are written in C++ using arrays, pointers, and STL where applicable.
- Problems include both function-level implementations and full program logic.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Arrays and pointer manipulation
- Singly and doubly linked lists
- Recursive functions
- Stack and queue operations
- Tree traversal and structure
- HeapSort and sorting techniques
- Dynamic memory and input/output handling

## 📁 File Structure

- `.cpp` files – Solution attempts for individual midterm practice problems
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🚧 Notes

- This repo serves as a personal archive of practice problems and study notes.
- Some files may be incomplete or contain errors, as they reflect an early stage in my learning process.
- Created during CS 20 while also learning GitHub.
