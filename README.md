# CS 20: Midterm Practice Questions – Data Structures

This repository contains practice problems completed in preparation for the **CS 20 Data Structures** midterm exam. The exercises cover various fundamental topics in C++ and data structures to reinforce understanding of core concepts.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of these solutions. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I was also still learning GitHub at the time, so some files may reflect early version control practices.

## ✨ Overview

The practice problems were based on typical midterm topics for a data structures course, including:

- Basic array manipulation
- Linked lists
- Recursion
- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms
- Stack and queue concepts

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Each file contains solutions or partial solutions to different types of questions expected on the midterm.
- Some problems are self-contained, while others build upon typical data structure implementations.
- Code is written in C++ using basic STL components where appropriate.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Arrays and pointers
- Singly linked lists
- Recursive algorithms
- Iterative sorting and searching
- Stack and queue operations
- Basic memory management in C++

## 📁 File Structure

- `.cpp` files – Practice questions and solution attempts
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🚧 Notes

- This repository is a collection of practice work and was not intended as a polished project.
- Some files may be incomplete or contain mistakes, as they were created as part of the learning process.
- Developed while learning both data structures and GitHub workflows for the first time.
