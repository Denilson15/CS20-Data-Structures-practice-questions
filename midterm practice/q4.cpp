/*

The following array is passed to heapsort : {9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}.

Draw the associated tree initially and after each call to fixheap.
When calling fixheap in phase 2 you only need to draw the nodes that are in the current heap, 
not the values that have already been swapped into place.
